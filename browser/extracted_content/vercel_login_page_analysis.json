The primary call to action is 'Log in to Vercel', followed by options to continue with email, Google, GitHub, SAML SSO, or Passkey. There's also an option to 'Show other options'. For new users, a 'Sign Up' link is prominently displayed. The page includes standard footer links for 'Terms' and 'Privacy Policy'. The URL itself indicates a redirection parameter (`next`) after successful login, pointing to a specific Vercel project's SSO API, suggesting the login is part of an authentication flow for an application.",
